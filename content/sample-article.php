    <p>If you want to find better job opportunities, start by clarifying the roles and industries that actually interest you. Narrowing your focus will make networking and applications far more effective.</p>
    <h2>1. Polish your profile</h2>
    <p>Update your résumé and online profiles with measurable achievements: numbers, outcomes, and concise descriptions of what you accomplished. Recruiters scan for impact, not long lists of duties.</p>
    <h2>2. Targeted search</h2>
    <p>Use focused searches on job boards, company career pages, and professional networks. Set alerts and spend time each week applying to roles that match your skill level and career goals.</p>
    <h2>3. Network with intent</h2>
    <p>Reach out to people who work at companies you want to join. Share brief, polite messages asking for advice or a short informational chat — most people are happy to help when asked respectfully.</p>
    <h2>4. Prepare to stand out</h2>
    <p>For interviews, prepare concise stories about how you solved problems and drove results. Practice clear, confident answers to common questions and have thoughtful questions ready for interviewers.</p>
    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Keep a tracker for roles applied to and follow up after interviews. Regularly revise your approach based on feedback. With persistence and a focused strategy, you will find better opportunities.</p>
